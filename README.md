# Project description
‘Studec’ provides a platform service for researchers and research participants. In Korea graduate students get a lot of troubles in gathering research participants. Researchers promote their research by themselves or requests an agency gathering participants for high costs. Research participants also participate in research or survey for a part time job, however agency got an excessive profit for mediation therefore participants’ entry fee isn’t arranged fairly. This kind of poor research environments finally contributes to lower quality of researches and thesis
In America, popular platform service M-Turk plays a role of connecting researchers and participants. By benchmarking this service with our insights, we’ll develop a platform services for researchers and participants and wish to contribute to improve research environments in Korea. Not just coping M-Turk but by combining loopchain of ICX with our platform, we expect a powerful synergy in this service.
When we benchmarks M-Turk, Several parts, such as databases and DeFi, can be loaded into the icon network. Initially, Users use this service for connecting a researcher and a participant, and using as the DB to contain the research process, results, etc. Later, when The community being activated, we will introduce LICX for DeFi system. This is IRC2 tokens and can be exchanged for researchers cash or participants cash by form of wallet. If our service can provide a wallet system, Use case would be more diversified than initially planned.

# What is included in MVP
1. LoopChain
 In our platform research data moves on non-modifiable and undeletable ledger of Loopchain network, it could prevent a data fabrications in thesis
2. Network-community systems 
 In M-Turk from Aws, Participants often give a proposal for research with good intentions , we’ll extend this function by benchmarking Steem’s case. We will make a community that has a monetary reward system in additional activities like proposals or debates in our platforms. By running this community, we expect to stablish an active debate cultures in research environments and contribute to an interdisciplinary researches in Korea.
# Dev SetUp
## Use Vue.js 

- Vue.js Installation (prepare npm)
### Command : npm install vue

- vue-cli Installation 
-- The Vue CLI is a vue official CLI that helps create the Vue.js project. The Vue CLI enables the use of the vue command and enables rapid project creation and management. It can be installed using the npm, yarn commands as follows.
### Command 1 : npm install -g @vue/cli 
### Command 2 : yarn global add @vue/cli

- Create Project (Use Webpack)
### Command : vue init webpack Project_name

- Start dev (if you use yarn )
### Command : cd Project_name 
### Command : npm run dev

Now check your project screen in localhost

### localhost url : http://localhost:8080

But if already installed "Vue cli",  
just Command : vue create Project_name
- Start dev (if you use yarn )
### Command : cd Project_name 
### Command : yarn serve 
Execution Webpack
